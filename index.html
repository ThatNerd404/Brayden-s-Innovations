                <h1>Welcome!</h1>
                <p>Hello World and Welcome to my awesome website! This website holds all the projects I have made and anything I'm really passionate about.
                Here you will find (In due time coding is hard) a working game of pong, a gallery of funny photoshopped pictures, all my coding projects
                and more! This site is a love-letter to the internet of old (or web 1.0), a place which I never grew up with but, in comparison to what we
                currently have which is sleek and advertisement filled slop, it is truly a dream of mine. I adore the decentralized and anonymous nature,
                the wacky and colorful UIs, but, most importantly, I adore the community behind the websites. That community makes even the worst website
                seem like gold compared to a soulless corporate masterpiece. Brayden's Innovations is a culmination of everything that makes me who I am 
                and I hope you can find something you like here or at least you will find yourself entertained here. 
                </p>

                <p>I am Brayden! A beginner programmer hoping to get into the software development field and show what I can do! I have been interested
                in computers from a young age and have only recently come across the wonderful world of web development! I see the beauty and wonder in the
                creation of websites and being frank I believe everyone should have one. As a younger guy myself, I have only grown around the internet 
                run and controlled by big congolmerates but I long for the decentralized internet of old. Which is why I created this website! I hope I can 
                inspire at least one person to take part in the wonderful act of creation of something as beautiful as a website! To anyone reading this
                know that you are loved and that everyday is a gift. Go out in the world and do something, I implore you!

                <p>You should expect a smooth, beautiful UI and a fun experince! I also plan on giving this website regular updates so be ready to see
                   changes to the website each time you visit!
