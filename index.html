            <p>Hello World and Welcome to my website! This website will hold all my projects I make and anything I'm really passionate about. Here you 
                will find (In due time coding is hard) a working game of pong, a gallery of funny photoshopped pictures, all my coding projects and more!
                This site is a culmination of everything that makes me who I am and I hope you can find something you like here or at least be entertained.

            <h1>Whoami?</h1>
            <p>I am Brayden! A beginner programmer hoping to get into the software development field and show what I can do! I have been interested
                in computers from a young age and have only recently come across the wonderful world of web development! I see the beauty and wonder in the
                creation of websites and being frank I believe everyone should have one. As a younger guy myself, I have only grown around the internet 
                run and controlled by big congolmerates but I long for the decentralized internet of old. Which is why I created this website!
