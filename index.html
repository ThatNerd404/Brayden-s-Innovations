            <h1 class="So_No_Heading">Whoami?</h1>
            <p class="She_Para_On_My_Graph">I am Brayden! A beginner programmer hoping to get into the software development field and show what I can do! I have been interested
                in computers from a young age and have only recently come across the wonderful world of web development! I see the beauty and wonder in the
                creation of websites and being frank I believe everyone should have one. As a younger guy myself, I have only grown around the internet 
                run and controlled by big congolmerates but I long for the decentralized internet of old. Which is why I created this website! I hope I can 
                inspire at least one person to take part in the wonderful act of creation of something as beautiful as a website!
            </p>
            <h1 class="So_No_Heading">What Should I Expect?</h1>
            <p class="She_Para_On_My_Graph">You should expect a smooth, beautiful UI and a fun experince! This website holds not just my work but everything that I hold dear.
                Please enjoy yourself! </p>
